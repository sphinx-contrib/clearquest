=============================
Sphinx "ClearQuest" extension 
=============================

A sphinx extension that adds a ``clearquest`` directive for converting 
ClearQuest__ requests to reStructuredText tables.

Syntax
------

The syntax of the directive is as follows: ::

    .. clearquest:: <full name/of the clearquest query> (mandatory)
        :username: <your username> (optional)
        :password: <your password> (optional)
        :db_name: <the name of the db> (optional)
        :db_set: <the name of the db set> (optional)
        :params: <parameters to pass to the query> (optional)

The connection credentials can either be provided as directive options or 
in a ``clearquest`` section in the ``~/.sphinxcontrib`` file which is a 
standard ``.ini`` configuration file. ::

	[clearquest]
	username = john
	password = doe
	db_name = prod
	db_set = cqsrv

The parameters to pass to the query must respect the following syntax: ::

    <param1_name>=<param1_value>,<param2_name>=<param2_value>, ....

You can provide them in any order as long as you don't forget one. 
The query call will fail if you do.
